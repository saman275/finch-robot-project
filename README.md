# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
Zen and I chose to draw a cross as our final project. It is a cotinuous line that creates the cross and takes up most of an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper.   
## Challenges faced and solutions
Some challenges we faced were connecting the finch to the computer and the solution we had was to restart the computer to restart the connection of the robot and the computer. Our other issue was with the code as we had to change the speed and degrees of the movements of the robots a lot as the first, second, third, and many many more tries did not end in complete succession. We were finally able to reach our desired outcome by testing multiple values in our code.
## Future enhancements
For the future we should definitely add a song while it's drawing the picture or making the robot light up with a cross on it as it is drawing the cross.
